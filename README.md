# allrecipes_scraper

This is a Python(Scrapy) based scraper to scrape Recipes information in detail from [AllRecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/) which is the world's largest community-driven food brand which publishes home cooks and recipes with detail.

# Dependencies:
- Python programming language
- Scrapy library
# Usage:
- This Script will use the webiste's sitemap to scrape all the recipes one by one.
- You do not really need to run it as I have attached the data already in this repository.
- If you still need to get an updated file, just run the scraper and it will create Data_New.csv file


Let me know in case of any issues or queries.<br />
